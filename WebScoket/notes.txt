WebSocket helps us to stay connect with the server and whenever there is a message we can send to the client
we build the connect by sending the htpp which is converted in websocket by an Upgrade 
and we stay connect to the server until we close manually..'
it become a full duplex connect(bidirectional) and send and recieve the message together


//Socket.Io is used
